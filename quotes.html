            <h3>Some of Maaja's CutieQuotes</h3>
            <p>When T-Bone shook his toy and splattered particles all over and they went into my food plate:</p>
            <blockquote><em>"All the good things that come from his toy!"</em></blockquote>
            <p>When Maaja, half asleep, was asked what she wants to eat:</p>
            <blockquote><em>"...maybe french fries and some salad..."</em></blockquote>
            <p>I forgot the context for this one, but she said it in a cute way with a beautiful smile:</p>
            <blockquote><em>"Yes."</em></blockquote>
            <p>When Maaja was the birthday star:</p>
            <blockquote><em>"I don't know how I should be."</em></blockquote>
