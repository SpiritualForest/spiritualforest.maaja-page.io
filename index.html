            <h2>About Maaja</h2>
            <p>This page is dedicated to the world's cutest, most amazing, best girlfriend ever.</p>
            <p>Her name is <strong>Maaja</strong>, and she's supportive, kind hearted, good natured, a little annoying sometimes, but overall just great!</p>
            <p>Also, did you know she's a great cook? I thought I knew how to cook until she came into my life and showed me how it's really done!</p>
            <p>She won the 2021 <b>and</b> 2022 Cutie Awards, and rumors are circulating that she's the favourite to win 2023 as well.</p>
            <p>T-Bone (aka It-Nobe) had another meeting with the 2023 judges panel and is confident Maaja will win again.</p>
