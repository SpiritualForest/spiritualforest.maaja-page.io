            <p>Avi is a difficult character sometimes, but still wants to be kind and loving, even when he's struggling.</p>
            <p>Recently, Avi hasn't been a good boyfriend to <span class="maaja-span">Maaja</span>, and for that he sincerely apologizes and wants to redeem himself.</p>
            <p>Avi loves <span class="maaja-span">Maaja</span> and considers her a fantastic, amazing, and overall great person.</p>
            <p>However, Avi also faces his own demons, and struggles a lot with anxiety and depression, which makes him prone to pushing others away.</p>
            <p>None of this is <span class="maaja-span">Maaja's</span> fault. And she has been very supportive, understanding, and kind. Absolutely the best girlfriend Avi could ask for.</p>

        <div class="apology">
            <p>Avi would like to issue a formal apology to <span class="maaja-span">Maaja</span>, for his selfish behaviour, lack of respect towards her and her feelings, and being overall a bad boyfriend over the past 2 weeks.</p>
            <p>My dearest <span class="maaja-span">Maaja</span>, I know I have been a bad boyfriend to you recently. This is not your fault.</p>
            <p>You know how I am when I struggle with stresses in life. And how it's difficult for me to concentrate on multiple things at once.</p>
            <p>The unemployment stress and depression that I've been experiencing have completely clouded my judgement. I neglected your needs because I felt so overwhelmed by everything, that I couldn't deal with anything else.</p>
            <p>You are the best, most amazing, absolutely greatest, most supportive and just overall best girlfriend I could ever ask for. I'm sorry for not returning the favour in your time of need.</p>
